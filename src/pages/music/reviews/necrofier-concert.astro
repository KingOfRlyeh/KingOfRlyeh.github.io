    <div class="prose text-[#444] max-w-none">
      I recently had the supreme pleasure of witnessing Houston black metal juggernauts Necrofier at The Secret Group in Houston. I, and many others, consider Necrofier to be the flagship black metal band of Texas. The only band that might otherwise take this title is Absu, who, granted, have a long-standing legacy. Still, Necrofier has come screaming out of the gates and, in just under five years, produced two superb, raw, and tasteful black metal releases.<br /><br />

      Their most recent album--<em>Burning Shadows in The Southern Night</em>--for instance, is a refreshing revival of certain sounds from the second wave of black metal, but with the advantage of (shall I say?) "modern" influences of Goatwhore and Necrot. Their lyrical and aesthetic theming clearly ties them close to their second-wave progenitors, but everything is bathed in a shade of distinct southernness.<br /><br />

      While Necrofier was the clear headliner of the night, the bill featured several opening acts, each offering their own take on the current state of black metal. Unfortunately, I arrived late and only managed to catch Divine Void, but what I saw was impressive. Their entire band was on point, executing their set with tight precision and undeniable passion. The only thing I wished for was that their recordings captured the same intensity--live, their sound had an edge that just didn't translate as well on record.<br /><br />

      From what I gathered, the earlier openers also brought solid performances, warming up the crowd for the ritual that was to come. By the time Necrofier took the stage, the audience was already simmering with anticipation, a quiet reverence settling in as the main event began. The lights darkened, and cloaked figures approached the stage. Each member began silently and solemnly lighting the candelabras that speckled the darkness until complete.<br /><br />

      From the first notes, the first putrid shriek, Necrofier captured the essence of what a true black metal performance should be. The sound was oppressive yet rich, raw yet perfectly executed. Each tremolo-picked riff cut through the darkness like a blade while the drums (which featured triggered kicks, odd for a black metal show, but I'm not complaining!) pummeled forward with unrelenting force. The goat skulls, candelabras, and stage fog weren't just for show (although I am a sucker for theatrics)--they were the physical embodiment of the sound itself, transforming the venue into something far removed from the mundane world outside.<br /><br />

      The crowd, at first stoic in their reverence, gradually began to erupt as the set progressed. At times, the room felt like a cathedral, heads nodding in solemn communion. At others, it was absolute chaos--a quaint pit forming in the center from time to time. At one point, I found myself and another concert-goer repeatedly throwing ourselves into the fray, igniting the pit whenever the energy waned. Once it started, it really started--by the end of it, I walked away with a bloody nose, a busted lip, and a smile. The pit might've been small, but it was ferocious! Just what I needed!<br /><br />

      The setlist was a carefully curated mix of fan favorites and deeper cuts, drawing heavily from <em>Burning Shadows in the Southern Night</em>. One particular song (I regret not knowing the title) stood out, shifting the texture dramatically. It felt like something out of Samael's early catalog--grim, slow, headbanging chugs with a thick layer of menace and ritualistic intent, almost reminiscent of Baphomet's Throne. That moment alone elevated the set into something truly unforgettable.<br /><br />

      Another unexpected surprise was the prominent role of the lead guitar in the live mix. On record, the lead work tends to be a bit buried and forgettable, but live, it took on a life of its own. The additional melodic flourishes and solos added a new dimension to the songs, making them feel even more dynamic.<br /><br />

      As the set drew to a close, the band's stage presence remained stoic yet commanding. They weren't overly theatrical, nor were they cold and detached--every interaction was purposeful.<br /><br />

      Necrofier just about met my expectations, pleasantly so. They didn't rely on gimmicks or overblown theatrics; they understood black metal as a force, as an energy. The set was raw, intense, and immersive, capturing the genre's spiritual and chaotic essence.<br /><br />

      Would I see them again? Without question. If you want a true black metal experience, complete with fire, blood, and unrelenting darkness, you need to see Necrofier. There's no better black metal magic to be found from the great state of Texas.
